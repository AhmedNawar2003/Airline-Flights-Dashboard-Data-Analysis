# ✈️ Airline Flights Dashboard Project

## 📘 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline flight data to uncover insights into performance, pricing, and route efficiency.  
It follows a complete data analytics workflow — from **data cleaning** to **visual storytelling** using **Python, SQL, Power Query, and Power BI**.

## 🧩 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning (Python)
- Removed duplicates and missing values  
- Standardized column names and formats  
- Corrected inconsistent airline and route names  
- Ensured numeric and date columns were properly typed  

### 2️⃣ Data Exploration (SQL)
Using SQL queries, I derived insights such as:
- Top-performing airlines by total flights and revenue  
- Most popular flight routes across India  
- Average ticket prices by class (Business vs Economy)  
- Correlation between flight duration and ticket price  
- Performance comparison between direct and connecting flights  

### 3️⃣ Data Transformation (Power Query)
- Combined multiple datasets (Flights, Airlines)  
- Created relationships for efficient reporting  
- Applied transformations and built measures using DAX  

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization (Power BI)
I designed an **interactive dashboard** presenting key metrics and visuals such as:
- **Total Flights:** 300K  
- **Total Revenue:** ₹6B  
- **Max/Min Ticket Price:** ₹99K / ₹1K  
- **Average Duration:** 12.2 hours  
- **Business vs Economy Ratio:** 0.78  

#### 📊 Key Visuals
- **Revenue by Airline**  
- **Average Ticket Price by Stops**  
- **Route Popularity**  
- **Revenue by Route (Map View)**  
- **Flights by Departure Time**  
- **Airline Performance**

## 🧠 Key Insights
- *Vistara* and *Air India* dominate in both flights and revenue.  
- *Delhi–Mumbai* and *Bangalore–Delhi* are the busiest routes.  
- Morning flights show higher frequency compared to late-night ones.  
- Average ticket prices increase with the number of stops.  
- Business class tickets generate lower volume but higher revenue per flight.
