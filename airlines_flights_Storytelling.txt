🌍 From Raw Flight Data to Actionable Insights – Airline Data Analysis Project ✈️

In this project, I explored airline operations using a comprehensive dataset containing flight routes, ticket prices, stops, durations, and classes.

🧹 Step 1 — Data Cleaning with Python:
I started by cleaning and preparing the raw data — handling duplicates, missing values, and inconsistent entries.

🧠 Step 2 — SQL for Deeper Insights:
I used SQL to uncover key patterns such as the busiest routes, most profitable airlines, and performance by flight class.

⚙️ Step 3 — Power BI for Storytelling:
Using Power Query, I refined the data model and built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

🛫 300K total flights and ₹6B total revenue

💺 Business vs. Economy class performance ratio: 0.78

📊 Top airlines like Vistara and Air India dominating revenue

🕓 Flight patterns by time of day, showing morning peaks

🗺️ Top routes such as Delhi–Mumbai leading the charts

💰 Average ticket prices and stop-based price variations

🎯 Impact:
This project turns messy flight data into a clear performance overview — empowering airlines and agencies to optimize pricing, scheduling, and route strategy.
